# Loan Prediction - Internship Task

##  Objective
The goal of this task is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a loan application will be approved or not, based on various applicant attributes like income, education, and credit history.

##  Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about previous loan applicants, including:

### Demographic Features
- Gender
- Marital Status 
- Dependents
- Education

### Financial Details
- ApplicantIncome
- CoapplicantIncome
- LoanAmount
- Loan_Amount_Term
- Credit_History

### Other Features
- Self_Employed
- Property_Area

**Target Variable**: `Loan_Status` (Y/N)

##  Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values in both numerical and categorical columns using median and mode
- Replaced '3+' in Dependents with numeric value 3
- Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding
- Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler
- Dropped irrelevant columns like Loan_ID

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized the distribution of LoanAmount, ApplicantIncome
- Plotted Loan Status counts and income comparisons by Education
- Identified feature relationships and outliers to improve understanding

##  Model Training
- Split data into training and test sets (80/20)
- Trained a Logistic Regression model with class balancing
- Applied feature scaling to improve model performance

##   Model Evaluation
- Achieved an accuracy of approximately **77.2%**
- Confusion Matrix and Classification Report showed:
  - High recall for approved loans (1 class)
  - Balanced precision and F1-score

##  Key Insights
- Credit_History had a strong impact on loan approval
- Logistic Regression performed well with simple preprocessing
- Model is suitable for basic binary classification in finance

##  Tools & Libraries
- **Python**, Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **ML Framework**: Scikit-learn (for model building and evaluation)

##  Conclusion
The loan prediction model successfully meets the task objective. With clean data and basic classification techniques, we achieved a reasonably accurate and interpretable model. Future improvements could include using Decision Trees or ensemble methods for better performance.
